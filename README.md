# Where sparked this idea?

Previously in EClub's history a group of students created a 12x12x12 LED Cube. It was an impressive
and looked good, but it experienced the same issues that many projects similar to it have faced. 

**Documentation and Maintainability.**

Once the students that worked on the project had graduated and moved on, there were no longer any
people left that had knowledge as to how the code based worked. And without the proper documentation
for future students to work with, the project has fallen by the wayside, likely to remain just 
another object sitting in a corner of the room waiting to be recycled.

This is why we'd like to create a new LED cube. Not only improve upon the design of the old cube,
with it now being a 16x16x16 with 1" of spacing instead of a 12x12x12 with 2" of spacing. But to
improve upon the documentation process for the project, so that students and other club members are
better able to maintain the Cube in the future.

That is the main focus of this project. To build up and document a graphics library for the new
cube that should be easy for people to work with in the future.

# What are we basing it off of?

The idea for the new design powering the cube and some of the parts that we are using come from

Whose [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciaFar8nfHc&t=1s) about the cube and the code seen in his [Github](https://github.com/MaltWhiskey/Mega-Cube) heavily guide the path that we took.
